- [x] - Create a start button on the initial screen,
- [x] - After clicking, use the input tag combination to ask the company name of client,
- [x] - Go to the next question and ask the other party to choose a bright and open design or a darker and mysterious design. After the selection, the overall design will fade in and out into another style
    , that is, the entire webpage uses jquery or a method you are familiar with to convert the layout of the entire website into that style
    , and the user will continue to answer questions under the style
- [x] - What is your industry?
- [x] - Ask the other party if they have picture files that they are willing to provide as design materials - (minor debugging on the color)
- [] - Proceed to the next question, let the other party upload the logo or choose to design by us, and tell the logo design to be 10 dollars (including tax), and no additional fee will be charged (minor debugging on the color)
- [] - After the other party is willing or skips, ask the other party to upload other material pictures, and remind the other party to name the pictures in English (minor debugging on the color)
- [] - Then you can enter the card swiping screen, hey, pay every month on 20/30/40, or the total price of annual payment is 10 months, no need to pay extra host fees, no extra maintenance fees, website design fees no need

Each question will be rotated in a carousel-like way, as if you enter the next picture every time you answer a question, but we need the effect of fading in and fading out, so I would suggest using jquery to do it, it will be very easy, but just like I said, I would like to open the choose to you.
